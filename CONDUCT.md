# 飲茶 Code of Conduct

> TL;DR - Be excellent to each other

This document extends the generally accepted social contract of being a human
being and in particular one having lunch with strangers; be nice.

##### Supplementary

###### Lunchtime

Dim Sum is traditionally a morning/lunchtime food so DimSumJS is intended to
occur during your lunch break. This occasionally means people have to rush
back to the office so if you arrive late, you may still be eating when the bill
arrives.

###### Ordering and eating

Dim sum is a social meal so sharing food is absolutely encouraged. Be
adventurous in your ordering, pass food around and try a little bit of
everything on the table.

###### Tea

Tea is a central part of the dim sum experience. When pouring tea, grasp the
teapot with your right hand and offer to others before filling your own cup,
starting with the person on your left.

If receiving tea, thank the pourer by tapping your fingers on the table.
[Tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum#Etiquette) says to use your
index finger if single or index and middle fingers if married or if it's none
of anyone's damn business.

When the teapot is empty, turn the lid upside down and/or leave it on the side
of the pot, this signals to the waiting staff that it should be refilled.

###### Dessert

Don't feel the need to wait until the end of the meal to order sweet dim sum.
It's normal to order and eat 'dessert' dim sum alongside the savoury stuff.
